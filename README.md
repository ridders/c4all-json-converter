Usage
========

```python json_converter.py Path\to\json\file.json```

This script will only work for json outputs which "include files". If any of the categories intended for upload consist of hashes only, the conversion script will fail.

When commencing this script ensure the original json file is in the same directory as the "files" folder as generated by the C4ALL data migration feature "Export Work > From Work > to Hubstream". This is required as the script seeks out the "files" folder and renames it to a unique reference to allow the stacking of multiple C4ALL cases for upload within the Hubstream Intelligence Agent.  

If an error occurs when specifying the path to the original json file, in the first instance move the python script to the same directory as the json file and try again.



To Do
========
1. Include the option to convert json files which contain "hashes only"
2. Read in graded / categorised .C4P5 SQL files to generate a new .XML file for the purposes of importation into NetClean / Griffeye DI
